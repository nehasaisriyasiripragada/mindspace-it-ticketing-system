Web-based mental health IT support system
MindSpace – Mental Health IT Service Request & Ticketing System is a web-based support platform designed to simulate a real-world IT service management workflow within the context of mental health assistance. The system enables users to register, log in securely, and submit structured support requests related to mental well-being through a dedicated help form. Each request is stored in client-side storage and managed through an admin dashboard where tickets can be reviewed, tracked, and resolved, reflecting the complete lifecycle of an incident management process. The platform integrates user authentication, session handling, auto-filled user details, and an admin monitoring interface, demonstrating practical implementation of IT service operations in a digital mental health support environment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
